====================
==  I. The Story  ==
====================
Long shadows claw desperately away from your dusty combat boots, fueled by 
the relentless sun of a late Texas afternoon. Shading your eyes against the 
glare, you squint for the thousandth time at the line of soldiers ahead of 
you. It stretches on endlessly across the rubble, disappearing at last into 
the cool shadows of a troop carrier. Soon you'll walk up the ramp into the 
ship, climb into your one-man cocoon, tear through the interplanetary 
gateway, and smash down light-years away from the blowing sand and blasted 
ruins that surround the Dallas-Metro crater.

"What the hell is taking so long?!" you snarl, slamming the battered barrel 
of your side arm, the blaster, against your scarred palm. "I've waited long 
enough. Time to kick some Strogg ass." 

Slightly rocking back and forth under the sweltering August sun, you spit 
out of the side of your mouth, rub your eyes, and think back to the day 
when the wretched creatures first attaced. Like flaming meteors, their 
crafts pounded into the Earth and unbelievably, these bio-mechanical 
aliens... these hideous cyborgs... swarmed out while their ships still 
sizzled with reentry heat. They killed or captured anything that lived. We 
figured that the Strogg were after our planet's resources: minerals, 
metals, and water: things like that. But their onboard storage facilities 
did little to disguise what they considered to be resources: fleshy limbs 
and organs for new cyborgs, and of course, food. 

The line moves. And moves again. Into the cool shadows at last. The 
assembled armies branch off into new lines divided by corps and unit. 

"I can't deal with this shit - what's the friggin' hold-up?"

"Cool your jets, marine," Tokay mutters and smiles over his shoulder. 

"We'll all get a few Strogg heads to take home as souvenirs.  I promise you 
that."

"Yo, soldier, 3585." The medtech's voice startles you. 

"You in or out?"

Competent hands guide you into the coffin-like opening of your Mark 9A drop 
pod: sleek, dark, and invisible to the Stroggos defense systems. One of the 
techs begins to drop the reinforced pod door.  "Sleep tight, soldier. 
You'll see sunlight in less than six and a half hours. Not our sun, mind 
you." <SLAM>

Pitch black except for the mild glow of your video readout system in front 
of you. You've done this a dozen times in the sim classes.  No sweat.  Just 
a few short hours to sleep, recharge, and then the moment of glory. But 
this time it's for real.

It's also time to think. You recall your first official day of training, 
your unit commander discussing how these damn parasites made it to Earth 
and other nearby colonies in the first place. By employing our best 
satellites and long-range scanners, we learned how they traveled light 
years so quickly - the Strogg used these black hole-like gateways as their 
highway to heaven. We still don't know if they created these rips in the 
fabric of space and time, or if they simply discovered them by accident.  
Either way... it's just like opening the door to an all-you-can-eat 
restaurant for these bastards.  In about two hours, we'll be entering the 
same interstellar portals, to hit 'em where it hurts... on their own turf. 

You close your eyes and relish this thought. Eventually, you nod off to the 
low hypnotic hum of the troop carrier.

*Crackle* ... *fzzzz* ... "Greetings to the people of the Coalition. This 
is Flag Admiral Crockett, speaking to you from the bridge deck of Phobos. 
We are entering the outer orbits of Stroggos, the alien's home system. As 
we had postulated, Stroggos' atmosphere is harsh but breathable. We expect 
to make planetfall soon. Now is the time to switch on your debriefing panel 
if ya need it."

"Boomer?" the voice crackles through every soldier's headset. "Drop X-ray 
squad 
in 30 on my mark. You copy?"

"Roger that!" In another pod, your sergeant snaps back. "OK boys and girls, 
you see the clock on your heads-up. Two demerits for anyone who up-chucks 
during bounce and roll!"

*Shthunk!!* Your drop pod is shot from the side of the carrier and hurtles 
downward. *Wheee-oooooo!* Incendiary atmosphere howls past the pod's 
rapidly heating shell. *Ka-WHUMP! * The pod wall suddenly buckles to your 
right, but stays intact. Another pod must have clipped yours on its way in. 
ECM didn't indicate enemy fire. Shit. Thrusters and stabilizing gyros are 
fading. Based on the pings, the other pods are pulling away. Below you, the 
large alien city roars into focus on the screen. But where are the other 
pods? They were there a minute ago.

Suddenly, distorted radio chatter lights up, "Mayday! Mayday! Lost all 
power... shielding failed... missed dz... some kind of EMP is... kzzzt... 
us out.  We're dropping like fli... zzzzkkkzzzt". Silence.damn!  If the 
Strogg have electromagnetic pulse defenses and we failed to detect them... 
all of us are in the shitter.  That HUGE blip has to be the Big Gun. You do 
a slow dogleg left as your navcomp finds a place to land when all of a 
sudden retros kick in and propel you south. 

"What the...?" Before you know it you skip across the lip of a crater and 
slam into a structure, a good distance away from your target.  Dazed and 
bleeding from a head cut you toggle open the labeled arsenal bins and reach 
for where your gear ought to be stowed. Damn. Nothing but your sidearm. 

Damn again.

You leap out the crushed pod door, alone, with blaster in hand, and tear 
off into the room with the bittersweet stench of vengeance coursing through 
your veins...


========================
==  II. Installation  ==
========================

To install Quake II on your system, insert the game CD into your CD-ROM 
drive and:

1.  Double-click on Setup.exe at the root level of the CD, or
2.  Go to Run... in your Start Menu and type d:\Setup.exe

(substitute your CD-ROM's drive letter if different from "d:")
Follow the on-screen instructions as they guide you through the 
installation process.

** Note:  It is required that the Quake II CD be in the drive whenever you 
start a Single Player game.

For updates to Quake II, please refer to www.idsoftware.com.


===================
==  III. Set Up  ==
===================

a.  Goal of the Game
--------------------
The goals of Quake II are divided into a series of complex missions or 
objectives. During the game your field computer provides you with each new 
objective. It is important to regularly review this information.  The Intel 
Brief section of this manual describes general information on your 
missions, environment, weapons, special items, and alien profiles.

b.  Game Structure
------------------
Quake II contains eight large units, each with a number of levels to 
complete in order to proceed to the next unit. It is likely you will have 
to go between levels several times to accomplish a particular goal. 
Remember that once you leave a unit you cannot return unless you reload a 
saved game from that unit. Therefore it is important to review your field 
computer to be sure you accomplished all of your goals for that unit.  

** Note on Units:  If you wish to play a particular unit, without working 
your way through all the levels preceding that unit, you can.  We do not 
recommend that you jump into the middle of the game or skip any levels, 
since Quake II was designed in a progressive manner, and each level is 
important to the unfolding of the entire game.  However, if you want to 
just play through a particular unit, you can 'exec' a file which will 
launch the level and give you the appropriate weapons and ammo to start 
with for that unit.  To do this, simply pull down the console by pressing 
the tilde ( ~ ) key, and type the following command for the respective unit 
you wish to start:

To play :           Type this command:
Warehouse Unit      exec warehouse.cfg
Jail Unit           exec jail.cfg
Mine Unit           exec mine.cfg
Factory Unit        exec factory.cfg
Power Unit          exec power.cfg
Biggun Unit         exec biggun.cfg
Hangar Unit         exec hangar.cfg
City Unit           exec city.cfg
Boss Levels         exec boss.cfg

c.  Main Menu
-------------
When you start Quake II, a demo sequence of the game will begin. At any 
time, press the Escape key to pull up the Main menu. Use the up and down 
arrow keys to navigate, and press the Enter key to select. Each Main menu 
function brings up a list of secondary menu items. If you have problems 
using the secondary menu selections, please refer to the message banner at 
the bottom of the screen or the online manual for technical details.

GAME:  Start a new game with a specific skill level, load, or save a game.

MULTIPLAYER:  Start a network server, join a network server, or change your 
character information.

VIDEO:  Select either Software only or one of several OpenGL modes, and 
adjust screen modes and settings.

OPTIONS:  Customize your keyboard, mouse, or joystick controls, adjust your 
audio, and change your game play control options.

QUIT:  Exit the game from here.

d.  Game
--------
Under Game, you can select a variety of skill settings that range from 
really easy to nearly unbeatable. Each skill setting adjusts reaction, 
health, power, and number of the monsters you'll face. 

Easy:  This is meant for kids and grandmas

Medium:  Most people should start Quake II at Medium skill

Hard:  Here at id, we play Hard skill, and we think you should too, once 
you're ready.

Load Game:  Select Load Game to pull up the load game menu. The first name 
on the list is an auto-saved game. Selecting this puts you back at the 
start of the last level you entered. Use the arrow keys to move down to the 
game you wish to load and
press the Enter key. 

Save Game:  Select Save Game to access the save game menu. Using the arrow 
keys, move down to an empty slot, or one you don't mind writing over and 
press the Enter key to save. Quake II will generate a name for you with 
title of the level and the 
current time.

d. Multiplayer Menu Selection
------------------------------
There are two main ways to play Quake II with other people:  LAN or TCP/IP 
over the Internet.  This menu provides three options: Join Network Server, 
Start Network Server, or Network Server Player Setup.  Please see the 
detailed multiplayer section below (V.).

f.  Video Menu Selection
------------------------
Here are controls for changing your video driver, screen resolution or 
video mode, brightness, screen size, window or full screen mode, texture 
quality, and translucent settings.  To change an option, simply arrow to 
that option, then press the right or left arrow keys to adjust.  Then, 
after making all of your adjustments, arrow to 'apply' and press ENTER.  
You can also press enter when on an individual setting to make that option 
take effect immediately.  When changing video settings, Quake II may blink 
from the screen, or the game console may appear.  This isn't unusual.   
After a moment of this, the game should resume normally.  Once you hit 
'apply' to commit all of your changes, the game will reload the map to 
incorporate the new settings, and this will take some time as well.

Video Driver:  You have four choices under Video Driver.  These are 
Software, 3Dfx OpenGL, PowerVR OpenGL, and Default OpenGL.  As you can see, 
generally this breaks down into two choices: Software or some form of 
OpenGL. 

***IMPORTANT: Your system may not support many of the video driver options 
provided by Quake II.  If a selected video driver is unavailable Quake II 
will return to your previous selection or to a safe software mode. 

Software:  If you are running under Windows 95, and do not have OpenGL 
supported hardware acceleration, Quake II will use this setting.

OpenGL:  With the assistance of OpenGL drivers, Quake II runs in 16 or 24 
bit color, with colored lighting effects, cleaner graphics, and improved 
translucency.  Please refer to the file 'release.txt' or 'Release 
Notes.doc' in the '\quake\docs' directory on your hard drive for the latest 
required driver numbers.

3Dfx OpenGL:  Use the 3Dfx OpenGL driver on systems that possess a 3Dfx 
Voodoo and Voodoo Rush accelerator.

PowerVR OpenGL:  Use the PowerVR OpenGL driver on systems running Windows 
95 with a PowerVR PCX2 board installed.

System OpenGL:  The System OpenGL driver allows Quake II to render using 
the default OpenGL driver installed in the system. Select this if running 
under Windows NT when using a 2D/3D accelerator other than those 
specifically supported in this menu. 

***IMPORTANT:  We do not recommend using OpenGL on systems that do not have 
hardware acceleration of OpenGL installed. 

Video Mode:  Many video modes are available to you through this menu.  Your 
system may not support many of the video modes provided by Quake II.

Screen Size:  The screen size slider controls the size of the game area on 
the screen.  Reducing the screen size will usually result in higher 
performance.

Brightness:  The brightness slider controls the brightness of the screen.  
Its effects are immediate under software.  When using OpenGL, select Apply 
after modifying the brightness.

Fullscreen:  This selects fullscreen or windowed rendering.  Fullscreen 
mode availability is dependent upon the type of graphics adapter installed.  
Fullscreen software rendering requires the presence of Microsoft DirectX.  
Under OpenGL, fullscreen rendering uses the current color depth of the 
desktop.

Texture Quality (OpenGL only):  The texture quality slider determines the 
overall crispness of textures with OpenGL renderers.  Better quality often 
results in lower performance.

8-Bit Textures (OpenGL only):  8-bit texture support is available on some 
graphics chipsets such as the 3Dfx Voodoo.  Enabling 8-bit textures reduces 
visual quality in exchange for better overall performance.
***IMPORTANT: We recommend you use this setting if you have the appropriate 
hardware and want to increase the performance of Quake II.

Stipple Alpha (Software only): Enabling stipple alpha results in faster 
performance when rendering transparent surfaces such as windows, water, and 
lava, but also results in reduced image quality when rendering transparent
surfaces.

Apply:  Selecting this option "applies" any modifications you make to your 
video configuration. 

g.  Options
-----------
Here you can adjust your audio settings, change your mouse options, 
customize your keyboard settings, and restore all your control settings to 
their defaults.

SFX Volume:  Using the left and right arrow keys moves the slider bar to 
increase or decrease the volume of your sound effects.

Sound Quality:  Select low quality for 11 kHz sound and high quality for 22 
kHz sound.  Using low sound quality may increase the performance of Quake 
II on your machine.

CD Music:  Use the left and right arrow keys to turn CD music on or off.  
Turning the CD off will not change the performance of the game.

Mouse Speed:  This allows you to adjust your mouse sensitivity.  The higher 
you set this the faster your character will turn in relation to mouse 
movement.

Always Run:  Set this to Yes if you do not want to hold down the Run button 
in order to move quickly.

Invert Mouse:  This gives your mouse "airplane-style" controls.  This means 
that pushing the mouse forward "noses down" and pulling it back "noses up."  
Some people prefer this control technique.

Lookspring:  Returns your view immediately to straight ahead when you 
release the look up key, look down key or mouse look.  Otherwise, you must 
move forward for a step or two before your view snaps back.  Lookspring 
does not work while you are underwater.

Lookstrafe:  If you are using the look up or look down key, then this 
option causes you to sidestep instead of turn when you try to move left or 
right.

Freelook:  With this option enabled you no longer have to press the mouse 
look key to look up and down while using the mouse.

Disable Alt-Tab:  This will disable moving from Quake II to your Windows 
desktop by pressing the Alt and the Tab key.

Customize Controls: Selecting this option will bring up a second menu that 
lists all of the game controls. Use the arrow keys to move through the 
list.  Press the Enter key to select a control to change.  Press the 
appropriate key or mouse button that you wish to use for that control.  If 
you want to go back to the original controls, go to the previous menu and 
select Reset Defaults.

h.  On-Screen Information During Gameplay
-----------------------------------------
Status Bar:  Your status is shown as icons floating in your view at the 
bottom of the screen.  There is an indicator for your health, armor, ammo 
for the current weapon, and currently selected or readied item or weapon.  
When you pick up something new, an icon will briefly appear at the bottom 
of the screen with a picture of that item.  To view all of your inventory, 
press the Tab key.  Maximizing the screen (+ key) may remove the Status Bar 
from your viewing area.  To get it back, simply press the - key.

Messages:  Quake II will talk to you from time to time.  Some messages 
appear at the top of the screen.  These are non-critical, and tell you that 
you've picked up an object, or you've died in an interesting fashion 
(multiplayer games).  Certain messages will appear in the middle of the 
screen.  These are always important, and you do not want to ignore them!  
Examples are "You Need the Red Key" or "Crouch Here," etc.

Field Computer:  Press the F1 key to access the field computer.  This 
details your unit location, your primary objective, secondary or current 
objective, kill ratio, goals completed, and number of secrets found.  When 
your field computer receives an update an icon will appear at the bottom of 
the screen. Be sure to regularly check the computer for information on 
progressing to your next objective.

Console:  Pressing the tilde key (~) will pull down the Console window.  
This is a special area that lists all of the game messages, and allows you 
to give Quake II commands that cannot be entered through the menu.  For 
more information on the Console, please refer to the online manual.

Inventory:  Press the Tab key to access your inventory. Use the bracket ([ 
]) keys to move through the list.  Your status information will update to 
show an image of the currently selected item.  Press the Enter key to use a 
highlighted item or press the single quote key ( ' ) to drop an item.  
(Dropping items is only useful for multiplayer games.)  Weapons and items 
are "readied" in this manner.  For example, you can select or ready an item 
before engaging the enemy. Then at the appropriate time you can quickly use 
that item by pressing the Enter key.


===================================
==  IV. Getting Around Stroggos  ==
===================================

a.  Movement
------------
Walking:  Use the four arrow keys or the mouse to walk around.  To walk 
steadily forward, hold down the forward key (the up arrow or center button 
on the mouse).  Turn left or right with the left or right arrow keys, or by 
sliding your mouse in the desired direction.

Running:  To run, simply hold down the left Shift key to increase your 
speed.  If you prefer to always run during the game, open the Main menu, 
then the Controls menu, and select Always Run.

Shooting:  Tap the Ctrl key or the left mouse button to fire.  Hold the 
shooting key down to keep firing.

Looking Up and Down:  The letters A and Z allow you to look up and down, 
respectively.  Start walking forward and your line of vision will 
automatically readjust to the center position.  You may also choose to 
select Free Look under the Controls menu which will allow you to move the 
mouse around as if it was your head movement.

Swimming:  While underwater, aim yourself in the direction you wish to go 
and press the forward key to go in that direction.  Unfortunately, as in 
real life, you may lose your bearings while underwater.  Use the jump key, 
normally the Space Bar, to kick straight up towards the surface. Once on 
the surface, tread water by holding down the jump key.  To get out of the 
drink, swim toward the shore and you can either jump up onto the land or 
walk straight out if it is shallow enough.  There is always a way out of 
water, but you may have to submerge even deeper in order to find it.

Ducking:  Press and hold down the C key to duck and move forward to crawl.  
When you release the C key, you will return to an upright position.  It is 
also possible to avoid rockets in this manner.  You may notice some aliens 
have learned this trick.

Jumping:  Tap the space bar to jump.  You jump farther if you're moving 
forward at the time or if you're running.  You jump higher if you're moving 
up a slope.

Strafing:  Hold down either Alt key while the left or right arrow key is 
pressed and you will side-step in that particular direction. This is 
perfect for avoiding incoming missiles, rockets, or gun blasts from enemy 
Strogg.

Picking Up Objects:  To pick up items, weapons, and power-ups, simply walk 
over them.  If you are unable to pick something up, it means you already 
have the maximum amount possible for that object.

Selecting Items in Inventory:  Use the square bracket keys ([ ]) to cycle 
through items in your inventory.  Press the Enter key to select a 
highlighted item.

Dropping Objects:  To drop an item, tap the square bracket keys ([ ]) to 
scroll through your belongings.  When the desired object is highlighted, 
press the single quote ( ' ) key to drop it.

Giving Items to Other Marines:  To give an item to another player simply 
select it from your inventory and press the ' key.  The item will then be 
tossed out for anyone to pick up.

Talking:  To communicate with other players in multiplayer, press the T key 
and type in your message.  Press Enter when finished and your words will 
appear at the top of the screen.  Look for a reply, unless your fellow 
troops have been disemboweled.

b.  Dying
---------
Each time you enter a level Quake II automatically saves the game.  When 
you die, press the Enter key to pull up the Load Game menu.  Select the 
first game name on that list to restart at the beginning of the last level 
you entered.


===============================
==  V. Multiplayer Quake II  ==
===============================

Quake II's "Multiplayer" allows multiple players to enter a game together, 
over the Internet or on your local area network.

The most popular way to play Quake II Multiplayer is a Deathmatch, which 
has no monsters, just player versus player!  The goal of the game is to 
kill your opponents more often than they kill you.  Each kill counts for 
one "frag", and if you kill yourself then you loose a frag, thus it's not a 
great idea to go swimming in the lava or juggle your own grenades.

After you die, press the Space Bar to reappear, or "respawn", in the game. 
You'll be brought back at one of several random respawn locations.  
Throughout the map you will find different artifacts, such as weapons, 
ammo, health and powerups, that are needed to be successful at destroying 
your enemy.  When starting a Quake II Multiplayer Server, you have the 
option of making weapons disappear when you pick them up and respawn after 
time (length of time depends on item), or they can be made to stay put at 
all times so your Deathmatch experience is a true fragfest!

MULTIPLAYER MENU
JOIN NETWORK SERVER - Allows you to search for and join a game.
START NETWORK SERVER - Allows you to launch your own server.
PLAYER SETUP - Allows you to customize your appearance.

a.  Join Network Server
-----------------------
Under the "join server" menu are two options that will help you locate and 
join in network games.  The first is "address book", which is used to store 
and recall the IP addresses or hostnames of Internet servers.  A good 
starting place for finding servers to add to your address book can be found 
at http://www.idsoftware.com/quake2/deathmatch.  The second option you have 
is "search for servers", which will display a list of servers running on 
your local area network as well as any you have entered into your address 
book.

To add servers to your address book, simply move down to an available spot 
and type in the hostname or IP address of the server.  To join a server 
that is listed in your address book highlight that server and hit ENTER.

To search for and connect to a server on your local area network simply 
select SEARCH FOR SERVERS, then press ENTER on any of the servers that 
appear under "connect to...".

b.  Start Network Server
------------------------
The start network server menu option is for configuring and launching a 
Quake II server.  There are many options in Multiplayer Quake II, which 
make the game behave differently.  When you have finished choosing all the 
options listed below, hit ENTER on BEGIN to launch your server.  Once the 
server is running other players can join your game.

INITIAL MAP:  This allows you to select first map for your Deathmatch 
server.  The server will advance to the next map.  What causes it to 
advance depends on the following two options.

TIME LIMIT:  Set the number of minutes that the game will run before 
advancing to the next map.

FRAG LIMIT:  Once any player attains this number of frags the game will 
automatically advance to the next map.

FALLING DAMAGE:  This determines whether or not you take health damage when 
falling from high places.

WEAPONS STAY:  Setting this to YES will make the weapons stay available, 
even after being picked up a player.  This does not apply to other 
artifacts, such as ammo, health and powerups.

INSTANT POWERUPS:  Powerups take effect the moment you pick them up when 
this is set to YES.

ALLOW POWERUPS:  This option toggles whether powerups  show up in the map.

ALLOW HEALTH:  This option toggles whether health shows up in the map.

SPAWN FARTHEST:  Switches between random spawning and spawning players in 
the furthest position relative to other players.

SAME MAP:  When the fraglimit or timelimit is reached, the map will not 
advance to the next map, but will start the current map over.

FORCE RESPAWN:  Forces the player to respawn 5 seconds after being killed.

c.  Player Setup
----------------
These options will allow you to personalize your player character, thus 
changing how other players see you in the game.  Once you are satisfied 
with your player settings hitting ESC will move you back up a level to the 
Multiplayer Menu, saving your player setup.

NAME:  This sets the name of your player.  This way when you frag someone, 
they'll know who did it!

MODEL:  This allows you to select whether your player is a male or female.

SKIN:  Skins give your player a unique look.  Quake II provides 10 female 
and 15 male player skins to choose from. 

HANDEDNESS:  Switches your weapon between right and left hand views.  Also 
allows a center aligned mode where no weapon is drawn.  Center is often 
easier to aim, and because no weapon is drawn the game will run faster.

A note on SERVERINFO:  If you pull down the console (hit the ~ key) and 
type SERVERINFO you will get back a list of the current settings for the 
server you are connected to.  This list includes such things as map name, 
server name, time and frag limits.

NOTE:  There is no cooperative multiplayer in Quake II.  This may be 
implemented at a later date.


========================================
==  VI. TCM Intel Brief:  Classified  ==
========================================
INCOMING MESSAGE FROM TCM MARINE COMMANDANT JAMES:

We have cleared the interplanetary gateway between Earth and Stroggos. In 
exactly three hours operation Alien Overlord will commence. 

As I speak to you, your pods are being fueled and all systems brought 
online. Activate your field computers. The following intel brief will 
provide you with your military objectives, terrain information, arsenal and 
equipment details, and enemy analysis.

Never before has there been a greater challenge to life, liberty, and 
civilization. This is a crusade in which we will accept nothing less than 
victory. No matter how long it may take us to overcome the Strogg's 
barbaric assault, the people of Earth in their righteous might will win 
through to absolute victory. Today we will make very certain that this form 
of barbaric treachery shall never endanger us again. With confidence in 
you, and with the unbending determination of our people, we will gain the 
inevitable triumph - so help us God.

So go forth and kick ass, soldiers!

OPERATION ALIEN OVERLORD:
[Geography] The core of the Stroggos civilization is the capital city of 
Cerberon. The highly defended complex is built into the base of an enormous 
crater named Crater Majoris. Between the northern plains and the southern 
sea of Stroggos, Cerberon contains the major defense, communication, and 
political controls for the Strogg civilization. At the southern tip of 
Majoris is a second crater called Crater Minor. Crater Minor contains the 
defense base complex for the city of Cerberon. 

[Political Structure] The Strogg civilization is governed through a system of
Warlords. Each is given strategic locations to command and control. A single
leader, called the Makron, is chosen from the Warlords. He commands Stroggos
from within the palace city located at the northern end of Cerberon. Losing
him would leave the Strogg confused and in turmoil as the Warlords battle
internally to determine a successor. This would remove any chance Stroggos
has for creating a well-organized strike or defensive position. 

[Defense Systems] Guarding Stroggos is a defense system we refer to as the 
Big Gun. This defense system detects and destroys any ship over a few 
meters in length. Also, to protect against ground assaults, a deadly laser 
security grid surrounds the entire capital city.

[Energy Resources] Bluish crystals called Steedium are the source for most 
of the energy that powers Stroggos. The energy gained from processing these 
crystals provides them with the power run their entire civilization as well 
as their planetary defense weapons systems (a.k.a. the Big Gun).

Military Objectives
Your primary objectives are to establish a communications uplink, destroy 
the planetary defense systems, disable the interplanetary gateway, and 
assassinate 
the Makron commander. Once the communication link is made, subsequent 
communications will guide troops to their primary targets, destroy targets 
of opportunity, and provide necessary ground support for the follow-up air 
strike.

[Communications Uplink] Your first objective is to establish an uplink 
between command and the Strogg communication computers. These are in the 
exterior military base south of the main capital of Cerberon.  This will 
enable continued communications, location information, and combat analysis 
beyond the base complex. Failure to establish this uplink is not an option. 
Once on the planet, the combat situation may change quickly. It is 
imperative that you regularly check your computer systems for updated 
orders. 

[Destroy the Big Gun] From the base make your way past the security systems 
and move north to destroy the Big Gun located on the southern outskirts of 
the city. Further intel will provide information to achieve this objective.

[Disable the Gateway] Disable the interplanetary gateway between Earth and 
Stroggos. Shutting down the gateway will prohibit the Strogg from launching 
further attacks against Earth. It may be a long sleep back.

[Assassinate the Makron] Finally, locate the Strogg commander somewhere 
within the capital palace.


The Stroggos Environment
The Strogg environment is in some ways like earth, but in many ways much 
more hostile. The Strogg use a number of standard systems for activating 
machines, opening doors, and using elevators. Their interface is easy to 
adapt to: walk to it, over it, or shoot it. Other elements of the world are 
much more hazardous and can be deadly.

Buttons, Floorplates, and Levers:  There are three ways to activate a 
switch.Touch it, walk on it, or shoot it.

End of Unit Complex Symbol:  The Strogg marked off areas to indicate a one 
way passage.  Once you leave a unit complex you cannot return.

Secret Doors:  Some secret doors conceal secret passageways or military 
supplies.  Most secret doors open when shot.  Others open by activating 
floorplates, buttons, or levers.

STRUCTURAL SYSTEMS
Doors:  The majority of doors on Stroggos open as you approach them.  If 
one doesn't open automatically, seek a button, floorplate, or key.

Area Doors:  Specific symbols indicate the exit to a given area.

Secret Areas:  The Strogg have concealed military supplies in different 
locations within the city.  Recon your surroundings closely. Sometimes the 
slightest variation in the environment could mark the entrance of a secret 
area.

Slime:  All over Stroggos are pools of toxic waste from their refineries.  
This slime eats away at your flesh unless protected by an enviro-suit.

Lava:  Stroggos has large amounts of volcanic activity.  Don't go anywhere 
near lava unless it is absolutely necessary.  An enviro-suit won't help you 
much.

Water:  The water on Stroggos is safe enough to enter without needing an 
enviro-suit, but remember to come up for air periodically.  Be careful of 
water currents.

ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS
Traps:  We know very little about the internal defense systems on Stroggos.  
Given their warlike nature and the importance of Cerberon to the Strogg, 
expect the environment to be deadly.

Explosions:  Found all through the city are explosive radioactive 
containers.  Stay clear of them in a fire fight or you'll up in 46 little 
body bags.  They're light enough to move, and short enough to jump on.  
Their explosive power can blow through weak areas in walls.

Arsenal
Explosions:  Found all through the city are explosive radioactive 
containers. 
Stay clear of them in a fire fight or you'll up in 46 little body bags.  
They're light enough to move, and short enough to jump on.  Their explosive 
power can blow through weak areas in walls.  Press a number key or use the 
inventory to select a weapon.

Blaster:  This is the standard issue rechargeable energy side-arm.  It does 
not require ammunition.  Useful for taking down Guards as well as exploding 
barrels and setting off shootable buttons and secret doors. Keep one on you 
at all times.

Shotgun:  This uses shells for ammunition. The spread of the shotgun blast 
makes close combat more damaging, but long range attacks easier.  Perfect 
for the less than proficient marksman.  The shotgun is effective against 
Strogg Guards and Flyers.

Super Shotgun:  This is the uncompromising big brother to the Shotgun. 
Choose your shots effectively.  The slow firing rate may only give you a 
few chances to bring down the enemy before he's able to engage you up 
close.  It eats more shells than the Shotgun, but the show is well worth 
it.

Machine Gun:  Although this weapon is easy to use, its light weight allows 
for considerable kickback that will push your gun up.  Fire in short burst 
until you can effectively steady your aim.

Chain Gun:  The chain gun makes mince meat out of your enemy, but requires 
an insane amount of ammunition.  The long spin up and spin down time makes 
the chain gun most effective for sustained attacks.

Hand Grenade:  Twist the grenade to activate the fuse timer.  The longer 
you hold an active grenade, the farther you'll throw it.  Just remember to 
throw at some point.  Throwing the hand grenade does not make a sound.  
Therefore the aliens can't easily trace it back to you. 

Grenade Launcher:  The grenade launcher is useful for delivering firepower 
into hard to reach areas or clearing out potential ambushes.  We do not 
recommend using the grenade launcher in confined areas.

Rocket Launcher:  The rocket launcher delivers heavy fire power to your 
target.  Be careful not use this weapon in close combat.

Hyper Blaster:  A hyper blaster is an energy chain gun with no spin up 
delay.  Its high rate of fire is incredibly effective at destroying the 
enemy and depleting your energy cells.

Rail Gun:  The Rail Gun fires depleted uranium slugs at super high 
velocities.  Take note of the distinctive blue corkscrew trail of smoke 
caused by the projectile - or better yet, see how many scumbag Stroggs it 
goes through before it hits concrete.

BFG:  Big, uh, freakin' gun.  This weapon redefines the word "wallpaper."  
Simply fire the BFG into a small room of unsuspecting Strogg and observe 
the new red paint job.

Military Supplies
Pick up these helpful items whenever possible.  Some items take effect when 
picked up.  You must select and use other items before taking effect.

Ammo:  There are five major ammo types: shells, cells, bullets, grenades, 
and rockets. Except for the blaster, you must have ammunition to use a 
weapon.  Each ammo type has a maximum you can carry. 

Armor:  There are three armor types: Flak Jacket, Combat Suit, and Body 
Armor.  Each one provides a certain amount of protection against both 
normal attacks and energy weapon attacks. If you take enough hits, your 
armor strength depletes down to nothing. So seek out unused breast plates.  
Pick up and salvage armor that is not as good as your current armor to 
improve your armor health.

Armor Shards:  Special remnant of armors, which add a bit more durability 
to your existing protection.

Energy Armor:  This provides improved protection against energy weapons.  
While it is being used, it drains energy from your cells when damaged.

Health:  There are two types of standard health kits: First Aid and 
Medkits. 

Stimpacks:  These provide an additional boost to your health.

Silencer:  This silences the discharge of any weapon. 

Bandoleer:  Increases your carrying capacity for all ammunition except 
grenades and rockets.

Heavy Pack:  This allows you to carry more ammo on your back.


Underwater Breather:  This provides oxygen when submerged in liquids.

Enviro-Suit:  This protects you against damage from hazardous liquids, such 
as Slime.

Quad Damage:  The quad temporarily multiplies all your weapon's strengths 
by four times.  Let the gibbing begin!

Invulnerability:  The invulnerability item renders you temporarily 
indestructible. 

Super-Adrenaline:  This slightly increases your health permanently.

Mega-Health:  This provides a temporary but significant boost to your 
health, but will wear off after a minute or so.

The Enemy
Unlike humans, the Strogg aren't just one race.  They represent a 
combination of captured and processed races; a bloody marriage between bone 
and metal, flesh and machine.

Light Guard
Description:  Weakest of the three processed humans, armed solely with a 
simple blaster.
Defense/Weapon Analysis:  Easy
Comments:  Although their weapons may only sting, they may attack in packs 
or summon help from the big dogs.

Shotgun Guard
Description:  These loyal troops have an automatic scatter gun prosthetic.
Defense/Weapon Analysis:  Easy
Comments:  He goes down easy, but packs a punch.

Machine gun Guard
Description:  Bigger, meaner, and deadlier than above... with a machine gun 
for a right arm.
Defense/Weapon Analysis:  Easy
Comments:  They tend to charge in droves and have a sharp eye. 

Enforcer
Description:  Strong, muscle-bound warrior who dishes out chain gun speed 
damage.
Defense/Weapon Analysis:  Medium
Comments:  These bullies have one objective in mind, marine - to fill your 
body with as much lead in the least amount of time.  They can take a 
beating, and are effective at ducking your ammo.  Also watch out for post-
mortem spray from their chain gun caused by a spasm in their arm.  Split 
once you see one fall to its knees.

Gunner
Description:  The fighting elite for the Strogg, outfitted with a powerful 
machine gun and an automatic grenade launcher.
Defense/Weapon Analysis: Medium
Comments:  This cybernetic terror eats Mutants for breakfast before coming 
to work - on you.  He does have one weakness, though. It takes a second for 
his hand to open up into the machine gun so take advantage of the brief 
delay. 

Berserker
Description:  He has a metal spike as one arm, a hammer as another, and 
moves very quickly.
Defense/Weapon Analysis:  Medium
Comments:  This bald mutha is one deadly freak.  He may hit the dirt easy, 
but he'll get up and is relentless in his pursuits.

Iron Maiden
Description:  Equally as powerful as the Gunner, this femme fatale has both 
an arm-mounted rocket launcher and flesh tearing claws.
Defense/Weapon Analysis:  Medium
Comments:  The cyber-bitch from hell... not the kind of girl to take home 
to mom.

GLadiator
Description:  With two massively mechanized legs and one shoulder-mounted 
railgun, the Gladiator is the daddy of all the adapted humanoids.
Defense/Weapon Analysis:  Medium/Hard
Comments:  Once targeted, you have less than a second to sidestep or you're 
toast. Also watch for his lethal left-handed clamp grip.

Parasite
Description:  Four-legged beast with a probe on its back. Once fired, it 
attaches itself and literally sucks the life from you.
Defense/Weapon Analysis:  Medium
Comments:  The Parasite makes Cujo look like Lassie on Prozac. 

Medic
Description:  As the name suggests, this threatening organism has the 
ability to awaken dead Strogg from eternal sleep.
Defense/Weapon Analysis:  Medium
Comments:  When he is not healing, the Medic moves about on two hydraulic 
legs, and is armed with a laser blaster that shoots at hyper speeds.
	
Brains
Description:  A vicious cyborg abomination with life-stealing tentacles 
protruding from its chest during attack.
Defense/Weapon Analysis:  Medium/Hard
Comments:  Stay out of range of his dangerous tentacle attack. 

Barracuda Shark
Description:  The only creatures indigenous to water on Stroggos.  Their 
blade-like teeth and spiked tail are capable of disemboweling you.
Defense/Weapon Analysis:  Medium
Comments:  They attack in packs, but generally go down easy.  Just don't 
become too occupied with them that you forget to take a breath.

Technician
Description:  An almost completely robotic brute, controlled by a brain 
that floats around inside it's metal body in a red preserving fluid.  This 
creature moves about by hovering on four jets that sit under its body and 
is equipped with three weapons: a shocking prod, a flesh-ripping claw, and 
a laser blaster.  Use energy armor if you've got any.
Defense/Weapon Analysis:  Medium
Comments:  The Technician is easy to hit, but takes a lot of damage.  A 
good slap from your super shotgun at close range will make him keep his 
distance.

Mutant
Description:  The Strogg refineries have spewed toxins into the ecosystem 
for untold decades causing this once docile creature to mutate into a 
fierce, fast, flesh tearing beast.
Defense/Weapon Analysis:  Medium/Hard
Comments:  Run. 

Flyer
Description:  A small two-winged monster, comprised of a controlling brain 
and a cyborg body that allows it to levitate.
Defense/Weapon Analysis:  Medium/Hard
Comments: The Flyer moves fairly quickly, travels in packs, and each wing 
is a laser blaster. 

Icarus
Description:  Relies on a huge jet packed attached to its back, with laser 
blasters mounted into his shoulders.
Defense/Weapon Analysis:  Medium/Hard
Comments:  With its durable shell, swift maneuverability, and insatiable 
appetite for destruction, the Icarus is an aerial nightmare.

Tank
Description:  Tanks have three weapons they use at random:  an arm-mounted 
machine gun, an arm-mounted laser blaster, and a shoulder-mounted rocket 
launcher.
Defense/Weapon Analysis:  Hard
Comments:  Get in, take your shot, and get out.  Repeat as often as 
necessary.  These metallic beasts can endure massive gunfire. 

Tank Commander
Description:  These Tanks are a special class, designed to secure the Inner 
City from infiltrators.
Defense/Weapon Analysis:  Hard
Comments:  Consider planning your means of attack beforehand, rather than 
running into their view with your weapons blasting.

b. Release Notes
-----------------
Please refer to the file 'release.txt' or 'Release Notes.doc', in the 
'quake2\docs' directory on your hard drive, for last information regarding 
Quake II.

c.  About DirectX
-----------------
Please note:  Before installing Direct X, be warned that doing so has been 
known to do unusual things to computer it's being installed on.  Direct X 
is a MICROSOFT product and is an extension to your Operating System, 
Windows 95 or NT, it is not an id Software product.

During the Quake II installation process the installer will determine if 
Microsoft DirectX 5 needs to be installed on your computer. If so, the 
Microsoft DirectX 5 setup program will ask you whether you would like to 
install the appropriate files on your computer. If you choose not to 
install DirectX 5, and you find that later you need to install DirectX 5, 
follow these directions. With the Quake II disc in your CD-ROM drive, 
install Microsoft DirectX 5 by right mouse clicking on the Quake II CD icon 
to get the Context menu. From that menu, select Install DirectX.

Quake II utilizes the DirectDraw and DirectSound components of DirectX.  
CERTAIN FULL-SCREEN VIDEO MODES IN QUAKE II ARE ONLY AVAILABLE IF 
DIRECTDRAW IS INSTALLED ON YOUR SYSTEM.

Who makes DirectX and how can I contact them?
Microsoft created DirectX. If the answer to the question you are looking 
for is not found on this page, you may want to contact Microsoft via mail 
at:

Microsoft Customer Sales and Service
One Microsoft Way
Redmond, WA 98052-6399, USA

Microsoft can also be reached in the USA at (800) 426-9400, or 
internationally at +1(206) 882-8080.

What is DirectX and why do I need it?
Microsoft's DirectX 5 is an API (Application Programming Interface) set 
that increases the speed at which games play under the Windows 95 operating 
system. These APIs allow direct access to the enhanced features of hardware 
under Windows 95. With DirectX 5, a program has instant access to the 
hardware, allowing for advances in graphics, sound, video, 3-D, and network 
capabilities of games.

Since Windows 95 and DirectX 5 are relatively new in the computer world and 
have not achieved compatibility with some older video cards, many 
manufacturers are releasing updated drivers for Windows 95 to meet the 
DirectX standard. If you are not sure about your video card's 
compatibility, consult the company that makes your video card.

If the Microsoft DirectX Installer does not detect DirectX 5 on your 
computer, it can install DirectX 5 for you. After installation is complete, 
you will need to restart your computer in order for DirectX 5 to take 
effect.

If you have other Windows 95 games on your computer, chances are you 
already have an earlier version of DirectX installed on your computer. In 
this case, if you choose to install DirectX the Microsoft Installer will 
overwrite that version with DirectX 5. The DirectX installation process 
will then be complete. You will need to restart your computer for the 
changes to take effect.

If you already have DirectX 5 installed on your computer, the Microsoft 
DirectX 5 installer will detect it and not overwrite any DirectX 5 files. 
You will not need to restart your computer after installation in order to 
run Quake II.

DirectX 5 should not affect any titles designed for the original version of 
DirectX. Should you encounter difficulties with DirectX 5, please contact 
Microsoft for further information. 


How do I check to see if my computer supports DirectX?
1. Place the disc in the CD-ROM drive and exit from any AutoPlay screens.
2. Double-click on "My Computer".
3. Right-click on your CD-ROM drive and choose Install DirectX.

If any of the components of DirectX are not certified, please call your 
hardware manufacturer for the updated drivers that support DirectX.

Here is a list of common questions and answers people have regarding Direct 
X.

Q:  I am having problems running Quake II and think it might be related to 
my Direct X installation.  What should I do?
A:  If you experience problems running Quake II, try turning off the 
"Enable 3D Acceleration" option in the DirectX setup program.  To disable 
3D Acceleration, double click on the dxsetup icon located in Program 
Files\DirectX\Setup.  Uncheck the option for 3D acceleration in the middle 
of the DXSetup window.

Q:  I have heard DirectX is not compatible with some video cards.  What can 
you tell me about that?
A:  Windows 95 and DirectX are relatively new in the computer world and 
have not achieved compatibility with some older video cards.  Many 
manufacturers are releasing updated drivers to meet the DirectX standard.

Q:  If I don't have DirectX, will Quake II install it for me?
A:  Yes.  If the Microsoft DirectX Installer does not detect DirectX on 
your computer, it will give you the option to install DirectX.  After 
installation is complete, you will need to restart your computer in order 
for DirectX to take effect.


Q:  If the DirectX Installer copied over a previous version, will the 
UnInstaller remove DirectX 5?  How will this affect my other Windows 95 
games?
A:  DirectX 5 will remain on your computer and you will be able to run 
other Windows 95 games that use Microsoft's DirectX libraries.  DirectX 5 
should not affect any titles designed for the original version of DirectX.  
Should you encounter difficulties with DirectX 5, please contact Microsoft 
for further information (address and phone number listed above).

Q:  How do I restore my video and/or audio drivers once DirectX has been 
installed?

A:
1.  Place the disc in the CD-ROM drive and exit from any AutoPlay screens.
2.  Double-click on "My Computer".
3.  Right-click on your CD-ROM drive and choose Install DirectX.
4.  Choose the button that satisfies your need (e.g. Restore Audio 
drivers).  This process will install your previous drivers and prompt you 
to restart Microsoft Windows.

If you need further assistance, please contact your video card manufacturer 
directly.

Quake II is designed to take advantage of whatever enhanced video, sound, 
and input capabilities (such as DirectX or VESA VBE video modes) are 
present, but has fallback functionality so it can run on any Win95 or NT 
4.0 or later system, even if neither DirectX nor VESA VBE is available.  
You may experience problems running Quake II on some systems, because video 
driver and operating-system support for game functionality are not yet 
mature under Win32, and many bugs and incompatibilities remain in those 
components.


d.  What is OpenGL?  About the Quake II 3D Accelerated Engine
-------------------------------------------------------------
The hardware world is changing so fast that it is impossible for us to 
test, or even list, every 3D accelerator card with GLQuake II support.  
While some cards work extremely well, we cannot guarantee that your card 
will work as expected.

What is OpenGL?
OpenGL is a low-level API (Application Programming Interface) that works 
with a compatible 3D video chipset to render top quality 3D graphics.  Some 
of the features you will see while using OpenGL, and a compatible 3D 
hardware video accelerator, are 16-bit graphics, colored lighting, improved 
translucency and increased game speed. 

How GL Works:
When you choose one of the GL options in the video selection menu, the 
executable relies on an OpenGL library created for a OpenGL supported 
chipset.  In the video menu you can choose the 3Dfx GL library, the PowerVR 
GL library, or the default GL library that was installed with your card's 
drivers.

If you would like to learn more about OpenGL check out:
    http://www.sgi.com or http://www.3dfx.com.

If you are uncertain whether your card supports OpenGL or not, please 
consult your video card manufacturer.

e.  More on Quake II Video
--------------------------
Drivers
The video menu currently allows you to select one of four rendering 
subsystems: software, system OpenGL, 3Dfx OpenGL, and PowerVR OpenGL. The 
software driver is available on all systems. The default OpenGL driver 
allows Quake2 to render scenes using the default OpenGL driver installed in 
the system.  Typically this will be selected under Windows NT when using a 
2D/3D accelerator such as an Intergraph Realizm or accelerators based on 
the Nvidia RIVA128, ATI Rage Pro, and Rendition V2200.  Users should avoid 
using the default OpenGL driver if their particular system does not support 
hardware accelerated OpenGL operations.  The 3Dfx OpenGL driver should be 
used on systems that possess a 3Dfx Voodoo or Voodoo Rush accelerator, 
including the Canopus Pure3D, Diamond Monster3D, Orchid Righteous 3D, and 
the Hercules Stingray 128.  The PowerVR OpenGL subsystem should be used on 
those systems that are running Win95 with a PowerVR PCX2 board installed, 
such as the Matrox M3D.

Future versions of Quake2 may support other rendering subsystems.  At this 
time Quake2 does not support the Microsoft Direct3D proprietary API.

Video Modes
Quake2 supports the following video modes:

* 320x240
* 400x300
* 512x384
* 640x480
* 800x600
* 960x720
* 1024x768
* 1152x864
* 1280x960
* 1600x1200

Availability of video modes will be determined by the type of graphics 
adapter installed and available system and video RAM.  For example, boards 
based on the 3Dfx Voodoo chipset typically only support video modes of 
512x384 and 640x480.
